  <h1 align="center">Asteroid Application</h1>
  <p>The old atari asteroid game created using JAVAFX and brought to life.</p>
  <p>I've limited the amount of projectiles to allow only 3 at a time so as to not fill the screen with projectiles, 
  and have included a small video that previews how the application works.
  It stops whens the ship collides with an asteroid and the projectiles will disappear when they come in contact with an asteroid, removing both from the screen.
  Over time, the game keeps on creating more and more asteroids and each one that gets destroyed gives you points.</p>
